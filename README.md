# Vacant

Find a room in Heriot-Watt

## Getting started

You will need:

- NodeJS
- Javascript knowledge

This project uses Typescript —- there are many resources on the internet but to summaries, it's just Javascript but with a strict typing system.

### Actually doing something

I use Yarn instead of NPM but use what you want.

If you want to just run the thing, run

```javascript
yarn start
```
