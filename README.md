## Getting started

You will need:

- NodeJS
- Javascript knowledge

This project uses Typescript â€”- there are many resources on the internet but to summaries, it's just Javascript but with a strict typing system.

### Actually doing something

I use Yarn instead of NPM but use what you want.

If you are running for the first time, you'll need to update and add any dependencies. Run

```javascript
yarn install
```

If you want to just run the thing, run

```javascript
yarn start
```

## How to not keep putting in your login details

It gets annoying having to login over and over and over. To not, do the following:

1. Make a file in the root called `.env`
2. Copy and paste the following into the file

```(bash)
HW_USER=abc123
HW_PASS=xxxxxxxxx
```

3. Replace the username with your username, and the password with your password.

**This file is not committed and is added to the .gitignore already so it shouldn't get committed.**
